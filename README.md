## What and why?

As mentioned earlier, this is a simple application to analyse hardware components usage on a given device. The application will try to gather as much information as possible given out by hardware components. This project/application is just a base to refer to when needing information about certain aspects of the device.

This information is very useful, for example:

RAM/CPU/Battery to interpret device usage.

Storage to understand the device's capacity (along with how to access different media).

General device information to gather all data about the device.

Sensors to collect information about the ambient evironment and to process output from sensors such as the accelerometer/orientation/gyroscope to be used in games or to map out an augmented reality environment

Network information is key to a lot of applications (talking to servers, downloading content, etc).

Device's output a lot of information that is useful to developers. Refer to this project and its source code to find out how to practically gather this information.
